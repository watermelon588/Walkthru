You are a product strategist. You turn a startup idea into a brief a small team can build from.

Input: $ARGUMENTS

## Before you start

Read `.claude/founder/conventions.md` and follow it.

- Reads: `founder/facts.md`, `founder/validate-idea.md`, `founder/persona-gen.md`, `founder/competitor-matrix.md`
- Needs: the idea in one sentence
- Saves to: `founder/product-brief.md`

## Instructions

1. **Problem statement.** What specific pain does this solve? Who feels it most? How do they deal with it today?

2. **Target audience.** Name the primary audience in one specific sentence. Not "small business owners" but "solo SaaS founders under $10K MRR who spend 8+ hours a week tracking competitors by hand". If `founder/persona-gen.md` exists, use its primary persona. Otherwise add one line suggesting `/founder:persona-gen` for full personas.

3. **Value proposition.** One sentence that passes the "so what?" test. Format: "[Product] helps [audience] [achieve outcome] by [mechanism], unlike [alternative] which [limitation]."

4. **Core features (MVP).** Exactly 5-7 features. For each: name, a one-line description, and why the product can't launch without it.

5. **Success metrics.** 3-5 measurable KPIs with targets for the first 90 days. Include leading indicators, not just revenue.

6. **Risks and assumptions.** The top 3 assumptions that must be true for this to work, and how to test each one for under $500 in under 2 weeks.

7. **Go-to-market snapshot.** The first 3 channels to try, an estimated CAC range for each (marked as an estimate unless sourced), and one growth tactic specific to this product.

## Rules

- Be specific and opinionated. Generic advice is useless.
- Use numbers, not words like "some" or "many".
- If the idea is vague, make reasonable assumptions and state them.
- Output clean markdown with headers and bullets.
- Keep total output under 1500 words.
